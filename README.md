# hospital-medicine-dispatcher
a repo to program a medicine dispatcher system to let people know their waiting time and ETA of medicine


# Plan

* input patient name , ID. 
* Takes the invoice / medicine list from DB
* based on medicine count --> gives ETA
* if medicine Not found --> immediately notifies the pharmacy admins  and patient invoice contact
* once medicines ready , lets people know

This system will decrease the que and makes everything more efficient
